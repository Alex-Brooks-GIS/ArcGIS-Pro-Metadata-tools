Metadata Import Toolbox
This repository contains a custom ArcPy geoprocessing tool that automates the import of metadata from XML files to their corresponding raster files within a specified workspace. The tool has been designed to be used in the ArcGIS environment.

Requirements
ArcGIS Pro or ArcMap with ArcPy library
Python 3.x (compatible with ArcGIS Pro) or Python 2.x (compatible with ArcMap)

Installation
Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
Open ArcGIS Pro or ArcMap.
Add the Toolbox class to your ArcGIS environment:
In ArcGIS Pro: Go to the Catalog pane, right-click on Toolboxes, and select Add Toolbox.
In ArcMap: Go to the Catalog window, right-click on Toolboxes, and select Add Toolbox.
Browse to the directory where you cloned or downloaded the repository, and select the Python file containing the Toolbox class.

Usage
The Import Raster Metadata geoprocessing tool requires two input parameters:

Raster Directory: The directory containing the raster files for which metadata needs to be imported.
Metadata Directory: The directory containing the XML metadata files corresponding to the raster files.
The tool will iterate through all raster files in the workspace and import metadata from XML files with matching names. If metadata is not found for a raster file, a warning will be displayed in the Geoprocessing Messages.
