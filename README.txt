This repository is comprised of three python scripts which I have created to perform three main actions. 

Action 1: Identify existing metadata within a given file directory. 

Action 2: Extract key components the old metadata to a csv folder.

Action 3: Use the extracted metadata to populate an upto date XML metadata template that is ISO 19115 compliant 


Please note: that the second action has limited error handling, thus some manual clean-up in excel might be required.
When running the 3rd script (XMLTemplateupdater) you will require the template.txt and data.csv to be housed within the same directory.
